lesson.name = Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm
lesson.description = A shortest path algorithm, distinguished for \
   its use of a simple queue as the auxiliary data structure for its working. \
   This algorithm, independently discovered by several researchers, was \
   widely known since the end of 1950s. Its most notable property is a \
   polynomial time complexity even under the presence of negative edges.
