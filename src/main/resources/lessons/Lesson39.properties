lesson.name = Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm
lesson.description = A shortest path algorithm, differentiated from others for\
   its use of a simple queue as the auxiliary data structure for its working.\
   This algorithm, independently discovered by several researchers, was\
   widely known since the end of 1950s. Its most notable fact is a \
   polynomial time complexity even under the presence of negative edges.
