# AlgaT
AlgaT is an interactive environment whereby apprentice students can familiarize
themselves with common algorithmic solutions. This is a project mandated by
[University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/), CS course on a.y. 2019/2020,
asking to pick a few, selected areas on which to specialize the program.


## Usage
AlgaT can be run by downloading the precompiled .jar file and doing

```
java -jar algat.jar
```

on a terminal console.

## Testing
AlgaT provides a unit testing suite, written in JUnit 5. We suppose it to be
easily runnable from terminal or IDE tools.
