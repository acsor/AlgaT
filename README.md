AlgaT is a visualizer of algorithms where interact with common algorithmic
problems through a graphic interface. This project was developed as an
assignment at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/), CS course
on a.y. 2018/2019 asking to pick a few areas of specialization.

## Usage
AlgaT can be run by [downloading the precompiled
.jar file](https://github.com/newnone/AlgaT/wiki/Downloads) and doing

```
java -jar <downloaded filename>.jar
```

on a terminal console. Alternatively, using Gradle

```
./gradlew run
```

## Testing
AlgaT provides a unit testing suite, written in JUnit 5. We suppose it to be
easily runnable from popular IDEs or, again, using Gradle

```
./gradlew test
```
